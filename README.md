# Phylospatial
Scripts to do interesting things with phylogenetic trees and spatial data

### Lineage Distribution Models
* Python scripts to estimate the distribution of intraspecific lineages, to go with our paper in PlosOne
	This runs with ArcGIS libraries (arcpy).
	Warning: this section works but is not *yet* guaranteed to be user friendly. Feedback welcome.

* R script to estimate the distribution of intraspecific lineages. Lineage distribution models are now fully open source.	

### Phylogenetic Endemism (PE) and Phylogenetic Diversity (PD)
* R scripts to calculate Phylogenetic Endemism (PE)
	including sample scripts and data

* R scripts to calculate PD, PE and other metrics directly from a stack of species or lineage distribution models.

### Conservation planning
* Use Marxan to optimise area selection to conserve phylogenetic diversity (PD).  These scripts take spatial data and a phylogeny, and format the input files for Marxan.  This version is beta (20-Oct-2017) and feedback is welcome.  **NEW!**
