Scripts to do interesting things with phylogenetic trees and spatial data

* R scripts to calculate Phylogenetic Endemism
	including sample scripts and data
  
* Python scripts to estimate the distribution of intraspecific lineages, to go with our paper in PlosOne
	This runs with ArcGIS libraries (arcpy).
	Warning: this section works but is not *yet* guaranteed to be user friendly, but feedback welcome.
